        <p>A data structure is a way of organizing the data so that it can be used efficiently. Here, we have used the word efficiently, which in terms of both the space and time. For example, a stack is an ADT (Abstract data type) which uses either arrays or linked list data structure for the implementation. Therefore, we conclude that we require some data structure to implement a particular ADT.

            An ADT tells what is to be done and data structure tells how it is to be done. In other words, we can say that ADT gives us the blueprint while data structure provides the implementation part.</p>

        <p>Advantages of Data structures
            The following are the advantages of a data structure:
       
          </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Efficiency: If the choice of a data structure for implementing a particular ADT is proper, it makes the program very efficient in terms of time and space.</li>
            <li>Reusability: he data structures provide reusability means that multiple client programs can use the data structure.</li>
            <li>Abstraction: The data structure specified by an ADT also provides the level of abstraction. The client cannot see the internal working of the data structure, so it does not have to worry about the implementation part. The client can only see the interface.</li>
        </ul>

        <p> An algorithm is a process or a set of rules required to perform calculations or some other problem-solving operations especially by a computer. The formal definition of an algorithm is that it contains the finite set of instructions which are being carried in a specific order to perform the specific task. It is not the complete program or code; it is just a solution (logic) of a problem, which can be represented either as an informal description using a Flowchart or Pseudocode.
        </p>
        <p>Following are the characteristics of an algorithm:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Input: An algorithm has some input values. We can pass 0 or some input value to an algorithm.</li>
            <li>Output: We will get 1 or more output at the end of an algorithm.</li>
            <li>Unambiguity: An algorithm should be unambiguous which means that the instructions in an algorithm should be clear and simple.</li>
            <li>Finiteness: An algorithm should have finiteness. Here, finiteness means that the algorithm should contain a limited number of instructions, i.e., the instructions should be countable.</li>
            <li>Effectiveness: An algorithm should be effective as each instruction in an algorithm affects the overall process.</li>
            <li>Language independent: An algorithm must be language-independent so that the instructions in an algorithm can be implemented in any of the languages with the same output.</li>
        </ul>
